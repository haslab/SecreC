# SecreC Analyser

#### Description:
[SecreC](https://github.com/sharemind-sdk/secrec) is a _Secure Multiparty Computation_ language developed by [Cybernetica](https://cyber.ee/en/), as part of the [Sharemind framework](https://github.com/sharemind-sdk).

The SecreC analyser is a self-contained static code analysis tool being developed by the [HasLab](http://haslab.uminho.pt/) that aims to increase the level of assurance awarded by the Sharemind system, by allowing application developers to verify, validate and optimize their high-level SecreC programs.

This tool takes a set of specific analysis and transformation flags, receives a (possibly annotated) SecreC program as input and returns a transformed SecreC program as output. Its goal is to verify data flows and optimizations using formal verification techniques that go beyond the simpler analyses performed by the SecreC compiler. It currently supports typechecking, simplification and verification of SecreC programs.

A programmer interacts with the SecreC analyser in the same way as with a typical compiler: as the tool produces errors, and the programmer responds by changing the program, including its security types and specifications.

#### Requirements:
* [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) (with GHC version >= 7.8.x)
* [Dafny](https://dafny.codeplex.com/) (only for verification)
* [Boogie](https://boogie.codeplex.com/) (only for verification)
* [Z3](https://z3.codeplex.com/) (only for verification)

#### Installation:
1. Install each package `xyz` from the `packages` directory
```
cd xyz
cabal install xyz.cabal
cd ..
```
2. After installing all package dependencies, install the base package
```
cabal install SecreC.cabal
```
3. Add the installation directory to your path, e.g., `~/.cabal/bin` or `./dist/build/secrec/secrec`

#### Installation with cabal sandbox

Alternatively, cabal sandboxes can be used as follows.
First we have to initialize and update the git submodules.
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Next use cabal to build the analysis tool.
```
cabal sandbox init
cabal sandbox add-source packages/*
cabal install --only-dependencies -j
cabal configure
cabal build -j
cabal install
```

The `secrec` binary can be found under `.cabal-sandbox/bin`.

#### Usage:
For usage instructions, see
```
secrec --help
```
For cabal sandboxes, use instead
```
cabal exec -- secrec --help
```

#### Tests:
Before testing, make sure that you have the following packages installed:
```
cabal install hspec
cabal install hspec-core
cabal install hspec-contrib
```

To run the SecreC regression tests with nice output, you can invoke:
````
runhaskell tests/Tests.hs
```

#### Examples:

By default, the tool will typecheck a given SecreC program:
```
> secrec tests/regressions/arrays/00-trivia.sc
Modules builtin, main are well-typed.
```

For large SecreC programs, you can use the `progress` flag:
```
> secrec stdlib.sc --progress
     [=>............]  183/1674  11%
Modules builtin, stdlib are well-typed.
```

To verify the security properties of a SecreC program, you can invoke the tool with the `verify` flag:
```
> secrec examples/leakage/cut/cut.sc --verify
Modules builtin, axioms, cut are well-typed.
...
Verified 30 functional properties with 0 errors.
Verified 38 leakage properties with 0 errors.
```

You can verify particular procedures by initializing the `entrypoints` flag, e.g.:
```
secrec examples/leakage/cut/cut.sc --verify --entrypoints="cut"
```
