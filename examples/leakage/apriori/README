Algorithm: 
Compute all frequent itemsets up to a given size, from a database of transactions per row and items per column.

SecreC:
The apriori function receives as known leakage whether every itemset up to k is frequent.

Assumptions:
We assume that the algorithm is correct and computes all the frequent itemsets of the given size. Under such assumption, the leakage can be inferred from the output.
