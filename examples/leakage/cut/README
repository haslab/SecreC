Algorithm: 
A privacy-preserving cut that, given a vector a and a mask vector m, of equal size, returns a vector with the elements from a where the corresponding value in m is 1.
The idea is to shuffle the vectors and and m together (i.e., using the same random permutation for both), and then declassify the shuffled m before running the filter. Note that the order of the input elements in a is not preserved in the output.

SecreC:
The cut function receives as known leakage the number 1s in the input mask m.

EasyCrypt:
We need to prove that, for a shuffle function, if we know all the elements that belong to an input vector (but not their positions), then we can leak the shuffled vector.
