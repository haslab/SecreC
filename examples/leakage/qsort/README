Algorithm:
Apply oblivious shuffle to the input array and run a leaky quicksort sort that reveals the results of the comparisons.

SecreC:
The input leakage assumption of leaky sort is that we can leak the comparisons between all the elements of the shuffled array.

Assumptions:
Properties of shuffle, that rely on distributions, need to be proved separately.
Namely, if all the elements of the input array are distinct, then we can leak the comparisons of the (randomly) shuffled array.
