Algorithm:
Oblivious radix sort based on bit-wise counting sort.

SecreC:
No leakage.

Assumptions:
Properties of shuffle, that rely on distributions, need to be proved separately.
Namely, of we shuffle an array together with a permutation, and declassify the permutation and apply the shuffled public permutation to the shuffled array, leaking nothing.

Execute:
